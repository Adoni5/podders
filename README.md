Very simple native rust lib for writing POD5 files. No FFI Woooooooo LET'S GOOOOO

## Limitations
Many!
* ** Uncompressed signal** - I blasted this out in two days, so currently we are limited to uncompressed Signal.
* **Writing only** - Again does what I need it to do. I would like to add more features at some point, but for now we are stuck with this.
